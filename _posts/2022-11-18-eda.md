Between the time that I scraped the United Nations population data and now, I read this interesting article from Forbes about [world population trends](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/11/14/worlds-population-reaches-8-billion-this-week-heres-what-you-need-to-know/). To briefly summarize (though I suggest you read the article), the world population has now reached 8 billion people, but researchers say that most of the growth over the next 80 years will come from a handful of countries. I thought, why not explore the data from this handful of countries and compare it to minimal-growth first-world countries such as Japan and the USA? Thus, I edited my dataset with a few changes to my API calls and began exploring the trends!

I start with a few line plots from the *matplotlib* package in Python. This first graph models the variable *fertility rate* over time.
