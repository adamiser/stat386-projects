Between the time that I scraped the United Nations population data and now, I read this interesting article from Forbes about [world population trends](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/11/14/worlds-population-reaches-8-billion-this-week-heres-what-you-need-to-know/). To briefly summarize (though I suggest you read the article), the world population has now reached 8 billion people, but researchers say that most of the growth over the next 80 years will come from a handful of countries. I thought, why not explore the data from this handful of countries and compare it to minimal-growth first-world countries such as Japan and the USA? Thus, I edited my dataset with a few changes to my API calls and began exploring the trends!

I start with a few line plots from the *matplotlib* package in Python. This first graph models the variable *fertility rate* over time.

It seems to me that every country, whether it be labeled as "fast" or "slow" growing, has a declining fertility rate. The first world countries China, Japan and the USA have always had low fertility rates, but even they have declined over the past 40 years. Countries like Ethiopia, India and Pakistan, who all had fertility rates over 6.0 in 1980, have all dropped by over 1.0, with Ethiopia dropping from 7.5 to 4.5. And yet these countries are still contribuing largely to the world's population growth. 

How can nations with such rapidly declining fertility rates still grow so much? These next two plots may hold some answers.

![Fertility Rate vs Life Expectancy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esnt/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/fert_rate_vs_life_exp.jpg)

It seems that, though all nations have experienced declining fertility rates over time, they have also experienced huge jumps in life expectancy and infant mortality rate. This means that, though less babies are being born, more are surviving, and they are living much longer lives. Is this rise in life expectancy and infant mortality rate enough to counteract lower fertility and birth rates, enabling populations to still grow? According to the Forbes article, yes. And according to this next plot, we may agree.
