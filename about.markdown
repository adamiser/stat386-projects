My name is Adam Simpson. I am a statistics student at Brigham Young University. I excel at mathematics, statistics, and data analysis. After classes, I manage and direct two Mathnasiums (math tutoring centerx) with a team of 8 instructors and 95+ students. My other interests include Ultimate frisbee, disc golf, drumming (I'm the drummer in the legendary cover band "Freedom Boulevard" - you heard of us?), and watching movies with my wife. But perhaps my greatest passion is teaching. As such, I love making complex topics like math and statistics "simple".
