My name is Adam Simpson. I am a statistics student at Brigham Young University. I excel at mathematics, computer science, and data analysis. After classes, I manage and direct a Mathnasium (math tutoring center) with 7 instructors and 80+ students. I love making things like math and statistics "simple".
